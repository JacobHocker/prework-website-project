    <header>Jacob Hocker - A Budding Software Engineer!</header>
      <p id='personal_info'>I have done many things that lead me to the point of wanting to become a software engineer!</br>
      My past with playing baseball for 15 years helped me out with being a team player and to work well with others.</br>
      Playing the drums & guitar helped me explore my creativity and learn the true joy of creating something out of nothing!</br>
      Years of playing video games, trying out different things with the computer, and seeing the back end side of things while loving all of it!</br>
      Lead me to be where I am now studying at the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> on a part time basis to delve deeper into this passion I have aquired!</br>
      I could not be happier or more excited to grow and see how much I will learn.  Most excitingly being able to be creative with it all!</p>
